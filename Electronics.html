					<div><p>The Electronics department is responsible for the wiring and electrical components of the robot. The team members in the Electronics have to put their heads together to figure out the correct amounts of electronic connections needed to make the robot work. On top of this, members of electronics are responsible for building a test robot, in order to make sure everything is functioning properly before the construction of the actual robot. The Electronics members do a great job of wiring the robot every year.</p></div>
