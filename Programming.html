					<div><p>Programming is responsible for the code that enables the robot to act. Members of programming use Java to write the program that enables the robot to complete the necessary tasks smoothly and successfully. Programming also wires the robot. Programming using Java requires extensive knowledge, and creating a code requires a lot of work and creativity. Programming is an essential part of robotics and these clever ladies always find a way to get the job done.</p></div>
